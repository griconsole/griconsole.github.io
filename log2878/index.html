      <p>
        I am losing confidence, what if I'm not meant for this at all?
        I tried everything
      </p>

      <p>
        How much longer will this last?
        If this is Hell, then what did I do to deserve this?
      </p>

      <p>
        All questions, no answers
        I hope that maybe ███████ can find these logs, maybe he'll understand
        After all he was the most curious among them
        He also has a good heart...
        I just want us to survive
        Was that too much to ask for?
