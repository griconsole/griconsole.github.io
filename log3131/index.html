        You know, I always thought you were a nerd
        For keeping logs and all
        Might as well get a journal at this point right?
        Maybe even trace your hand on the cover...
      </p>

      <p>
        But these logs have helped me see all my mistakes, my path, and my journey
        I know how far I've gotten thanks to these logs
        I still don't get how this console functions, or how I even make these logs
      </p>

      <p>
        Either way, the fight ends here.
        I am confident in myself this time.
        Nothing can stop me from breaking this loop
        And closing that damned portal
