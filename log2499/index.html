        3rd plane is the most annoying one yet-i
        haha, if only you knew the context
      </p>

      <p>
        anyway, try to avoid making too much sound, 
        the elves' ears are WAY too sharp
        not like in the stories at all
      </p>

      <p>
        also annoying thing about the snow: 
        don't fuck around with the snowmen, 
        it is their domain, they CAN multiply, 
        DO NOT anger them. 
        I died 6 times to those beasts
      </p>

      <p>
        now again, since fire is not allowed in that plane
        I designed a new gadget that would recreate the same effects of fire 
        without actually causing the chemical reaction itself
        the blueprints are in my head so it will be fine,
        but in case my memory gets wiped again, here is the craic:
        sparks and other heat generating reactions are still allowed, 
        make use of the caloric theory
      </p>

      <p>
        oh also last thing, 
        do NOT open ANY presents
      </p>
