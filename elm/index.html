      <p class="code">Valenite</p>
      
      <p>
        Element Name: Valenite
        Symbol: Vl
        Atomic Number: 121
        Atomic Mass (approx.): 321 u
        Protons: 121
        Neutrons: 200
        Electrons: 121
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Category: Transition Metal.
        Ferrous or Non-Ferrous: Non-ferrous but strongly magnetic
        State at Room Temperature: Solid
        Color/Appearance: Reflective light blue, metallic sheen
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Melting Point: Low (easily melts under intense heat)
        Boiling Point: Very high (remains solid under most temperatures)
        Temperature Stability Range: Stable through extreme cold and high temperatures
        Density: Very high (notably heavy)
        Hardness: Sturdy, resistant to stress
        Malleability: Easily shaped and molded
        Conductivity: Moderate (used in controlled tech applications)
        Magnetism: Naturally magnetic; maintains magnetic polarity
        Radioactivity: None (biologically safe and inert)
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Corrosion Resistance: Completely corrosion-proof
        Affinity: Bonds only with Cerathium
        Oxidation States: None observed
        Solubility: Insoluble in all known liquids
        Stability: Highly stable, maintains structure indefinitely
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Energetic Properties: Reacts to human intent; clusters or moves based on deliberate thought
        Unique Behaviors: Absorbs cancerous cells on contact
        Accelerates wound healing (stimulates histamine production)
        Cannot physically hold other liquids or solids; instead forms a cluster
        Interaction with Technology: Perfect for drones and prosthetic systems
        Used in remote-piloted vehicles due to magnetic responsiveness
        Interaction with Life: Non-toxic
        Used medically to remove malignant tissue and heal wounds
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Date of Discovery: 1979
        Discovered By: A PSC field agent
        
        Cultural/Scientific Impact:
        Revolutionized cancer treatment and prosthetic development; considered a national research priority material.
