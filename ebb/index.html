        Shio was a gifted child, hyperfixated on explosives and the chemistry
        and engineering behind them. He spent his time reading everything he
        could and conducting secret experiments.
      </p>

      <p>
        During one such experiment, he mistakenly added a carbonated drink
        instead of a crucial alkaline ingredient. The resulting explosion
        scarred Shio permanently, both physically and mentally.

        Though his parents survived, they abandoned him soon after, sending
        him to an orphanage once his obsession was discovered.
