        I have just returned from QuantumCon, where I encountered an unusual number
        of individuals willing to discuss Quantum Physics without ridicule.
        Among them was a man calling himself Vale.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        He was… interesting. His face appeared damaged, unstable, almost as if it
        were a projected image rather than a physical form. I chose not to question
        it. His understanding of the Quantum Theorem was overwhelming.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Vale claimed to have worked alongside Einstein himself on an experimental
        project — a machine designed to stabilize a wormhole. One large enough to
        allow instantaneous travel to virtually any location.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        We spoke for hours. Before we parted, he offered me a position at the
        Georgia Research Institution. It seems he was once a highly regarded figure
        there.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Relocating to Georgia will be difficult. It is far from my current residence.
        Still, I could not reject an opportunity of this magnitude. I have already
        begun packing and secured a rental near the Institute for the duration of my
        recruit period.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Vale suggested that, should I prove myself capable, I may earn the title of
        Doctor — even command subordinates who would assist my research and attend
        my lectures.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe I have been exceptionally fortunate.
