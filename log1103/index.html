        There's this one place in Denmark, Esbjerg
        It has the BEST sushi I've eaten so far.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did you know that after the technological advances made for fishing that Denmark
        gained almost a monopoly on the fish market for a good while
        well of course the PSC had to shut that down since the 28th Amendment prevents countries from hogging all the goods
        kinda sucks because now the prices have went up by %125 since 1980, which was when the Amendment was fully in effect
        So now, the best restraunts in Esbjerg are creating new methods to trademark their fish goods
        they're imbuing a special sea-creatures ink inside rice and using that rice in their food
        Tastes kind of zesty

        Oh, were you expecting me to write something actually useful?
        Tough luck
