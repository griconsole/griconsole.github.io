        Did you know that Denmark gained a monopoly on the fish market for a good while?
        One of the BEST sushi I've eaten so far. In a place called the StoreFisk

        Never in my life did I think technology's advance could be this tasty
        Of course the PSC had to shut that down since the 28th Amendment prevents countries from monopolizing
        Tho, now the prices have went up by 125% since 1980, which was when the Amendment was fully in effect

        restaurants in Esbjerg are creating new methods to trademark their fish goods now
        Using squid ink and shark eggs they make the best trademark dishes...
        Shame, were you expecting me to write something actually useful?
        Tough luck
