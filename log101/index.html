        I can sense him, he's watching me
        He HAS watched me, he acknowledged my presence even before
        I do not get why he decides to act NOW of all times, cheeky bugger
      </p>

      <p>
        But I know you are different, don't fall into his tricks
        Find him
        It will be difficult but it's the only way to ensure our escape
